# Assay Compatibility

Assay Harness consumes Assay artifacts. It does not define receipt semantics,
Trust Basis claim semantics, or Trust Card schemas itself.

## Current Compatibility Target

Assay Harness `v0.3.0` targets the released Assay `v3.7.0` Trust Basis surface.
Later Assay binaries are compatible when they still emit the same schema v5 /
10-claim Trust Basis surface.

| Contract | Expected surface |
|---|---|
| Trust Basis diff | `assay.trust-basis.diff.v1` |
| Trust Card schema | `schema_version = 5` |
| Trust Basis claim count | 10 frozen claims |
| Receipt families visible in Trust Basis | eval, decision, inventory |

Use Assay `v3.7.0` as the minimum exact tag for this compatibility line.

## Harness Boundary

Harness gate/report behavior is claim-family agnostic. Promptfoo, OpenFeature,
and CycloneDX recipes differ only by their input fixtures and Assay importer
commands.

Harness must not parse Promptfoo JSONL, OpenFeature JSONL, CycloneDX BOMs, or
Assay receipt payloads. It must not compare model versions, flag decisions,
dataset refs, assertion values, or domain-specific metadata. It only preserves,
gates, and projects the raw Assay Trust Basis diff contract.
